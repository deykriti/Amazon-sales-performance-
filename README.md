### **Analysis**

The dataset represents sales transactions across different **regions, segments, and product categories**. Using **Power Query**, the data was cleansed and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy. Various **visualizations** were developed in Power BI to analyze and display the results interactively.

According to the analysis, **Consumer** customers contribute the highest share of sales at **48%**, followed by **Corporate** and **Home Office** segments. Among product categories, **Office Supplies** generated the highest total sales, while **Technology products** and **Copiers** yielded the most profit. The dataset included over **3,000 orders**, amounting to approximately **$1.57M in total sales** and **$0.18M in total profit**.

The study also revealed that **Cash on Delivery (COD)** is the most frequently used payment method, accounting for **41.57% of transactions**, followed by **Online and Card payments**. Orders placed in **Quarter 4** showed a noticeable spike in both sales and profit, indicating strong seasonal demand during the festive period. However, the **profit margin** remained comparatively lower due to discount-heavy promotions.

In addition, the **return rate** of **4.86%** highlights opportunities to enhance logistics efficiency and product quality control. The dashboard offers valuable insights into Amazon’s sales and profit landscape, helping business leaders identify **bottlenecks, underperforming areas, and untapped growth opportunities** for strategic decision-making.
